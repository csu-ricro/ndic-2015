									<br><br>
									Kenneth L. Busch is a Senior Investigative Scientist at the National Science Foundation Office of Inspector General.  He began at NSF OIG in 2002 after a research career in mass spectrometry at several U.S. universities.  He no longer has the data from his first research publication that appeared in 1978, and his ongoing quest for world domination is being delayed because his cell phone has a rotary dial.

									The Research Integrity and Administrative Investigations Division is primarily responsible for investigating allegations that, if substantiated, would result in administrative action rather than civil or criminal prosecution. These include allegations of research misconduct relating to NSF proposals and awards; certain types of employee misconduct; misuse of program funds; violations of NSF regulations, policies or directives; and other issues that are not of a civil/criminal nature.

									Data Carpentry is a partner of Software Carpentry designed to teach basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data. In many domains of research the rapid generation of large amounts of data is fundamentally changing how research is done. The deluge of data presents great opportunities, but also many challenges in managing, analyzing and sharing data. Data Carpentry aims to teach the skills that will enable researchers to be more effective and productive. The workshop is designed for learners with little to no prior knowledge of programming, shell scripting, or command line tools.

									Vice President of Research, Colorado State University<br><br>

									Dr. Rudolph is a former member of the Senior Executive Service, having served as the Director for Chemical and Biological Technologies Directorate, Research and Development Enterprise and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Dr. Rudolph has had an active career in translating interdisciplinary life sciences into useful applications for biotechnology development. His experience spans basic research to advanced development in academia, government laboratories, and most recently in the nonprofit and private sectors. He has published more than 100 technical publications in areas including molecular biophysics, lipid self-assembly, drug delivery, blood substitutes, medical imaging, tissue engineering, neuroscience, and diagnostics. As a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow, his earliest work at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) demonstrated the translational value of strategies used by organisms that survive environmental extremes to preserve defense products such as biosensors and blood products for field deployment.<br><br>
									
									As Chief Executive Officer of Adlyfe, Inc., a diagnostic platform company, and Board Chairman of Cellphire, Inc., Dr. Rudolph focused on development of novel hemostatic biologics for bleeding injuries. He secured venture capital funding and pharmaceutical partnerships while managing all aspects of development toward first human use. These efforts included managing early manufacturing and regulatory strategies required for FDA approval of diagnostics and therapeutics. Most recently, he started a new international nonprofit foundation, the International Neuroscience Network Foundation, and as director secured corporate and private philanthropic donors to fulfill the mission of the organization focused on brain STEM efforts and clinical trial management in underserved populations.

									He has a doctorate degree in zoology from the University of California at Davis and an MBA from George Washington University.
